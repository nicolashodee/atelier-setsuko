# üåø ATELIER SETSUKO üåø 
## A BOOKING WEBSITE USING A CUSTOM CHILD THEME. 

The Atelier Setsuko is a place of learning, exchange and relaxation around ceramics located in the heart of Paris.

Enjoying a good reputation, its founder St√©phane found herself in 2021 overwhelmed by the management of the courses and the communication that she was doing until then by emails. She wanted me to redesign her existing website and install an automated appointment management system. The whole project was done by remote working.
