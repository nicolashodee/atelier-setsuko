= How it works =

Once installed, a new tab called "Delete account" will be created within the **user's account page**. The user will be requested to type his current password before deleting the account and on submission a message asking for confirmation will be displayed.

After the account is deleted, the visitor will then be redirected to a custom page of your choice. The redirect can be configured under **Users -> Settings -> Redirects -> After account cancellation**.

== Installation ==
Please refer to the [documentation here](https://docs.wpusermanager.com/category/418-delete-account).

== Screenshots ==
1. New tab within the account page from where users can delete their own account.
2. User needs to confirm account cancellation. Example showing Firefox prompt.
3. Setting from where you can choose where to redirect users after they've deleted their account.
