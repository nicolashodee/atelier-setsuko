## WP User Manager Account Cancellation addon

Allows the user to delete their own profile from the **frontend account page**. This is an addon for WP User Manager. After the account is deleted, the user can be redirected to a custom page.

## How it works

Once installed, a new tab called "Delete account" will be created within the **user's account page**. The user will be requested to type his current password before deleting the account and on submission a message asking for confirmation will be displayed.

After the account is deleted, the visitor will then be redirected to a custom page of your choice. The redirect can be configured under **Users -> Settings -> Redirects -> After account cancellation**.
